I discussed with: Sam Laing and Nikola Kamcev

Difficulties: I have not taken a proper CS course since the Spring 2015 semester so the problems I encountered were more basic and workflow related. I had to relearn concepts such as Makefiles, git, compiling, and Linux workflow. As for the assignment, I struggled a bit implementing the separte class header and implementation file, forgetting to put the .o file in the Makefile.
